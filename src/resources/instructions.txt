This file is to explain the format of the txt level files.
The first inputs are for Goombas, this takes 2 inputs, x and y for each Goomba

A new line is then left and the next inputs are for pipes, with 4 inputs, for x, y, w, h inputs in that order.
Note: The height must be below the top of the bricks (400, I think... Will check)

A new line is then left and next inputs are for holes
The bricks are instantiated automatically, it is only the gaps between them (hidden bricks) that need to be listed here.
Each number will spawn a gap of 2 bricks e.g. 5 would make bricks 5 and 6 hidden
To find in from desired y position, divide by 50

A new line is then left and the next inputs are for boxes
Each box takes 3 inputs, x, y and contents.
Contents should be "none", "coin", "powerup". If it contains something else, it will show a ? box but no powerup will be applied
The standard y values for boxes are 300 and 150
Contents could also be "block" this produces a box that cannot break

A new line is then left and then the x and y co-ordinates of the castle are given

A new line is then left and then the x, y, w, and h co-ordinates of the image are given as well as the location of the image in
the format src/resources/others/Welcome/keys.png

Last is the tutorial part

Order:
- Goomba (x, y)
- Pipe (x, y, w, h)
- Hole (ground number)
- Box (x, y, contents)
- Castle (x, y)
- Static Images e.g. for tutorial
